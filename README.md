# ML-project-Heart-Disease
My project focuses on detecting heart diseases through the application of Machine Learning and Neural Networks. By analysing various medical data such as patient history, symptoms, and diagnostic tests, the system aims to provide accurate predictions and early detection, potentially improving patient outcomes and healthcare management.
